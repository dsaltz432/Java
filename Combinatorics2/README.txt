This lab contains one file and one class named Lab5. This lab focused on combinatorics. Part1 calculated ordering with identical items. Part2 calculated distributing dissimilar objects into similar bins. Part3 calculated distributing similar objects into similar bins. The lab required the use of the BigInteger class because some factorials became too large for ints or floats to properly handle the answers.
