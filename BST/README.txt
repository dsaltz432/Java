This lab required us to create a binary search tree. I used Comparable objects so that we could take advantage of the compareTo method. I then created an insert method that inserted a Comparable object into the tree. Then, I created print methods that printed the tree in PreOrder, InOrder and PostOrder. Finally, I created lookup and delete methods.
