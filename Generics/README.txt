Generics

This lab examined the use of generics to develop type safe code that generate compile-time errors as opposed to run-time errors. I first created a method that printed out an array of objects. I then tried to have that method be able to print out any type of object array. I first tried doing this by taking an Object as a parameter. I then used overloading to write several methods specific to different objects. Finally, I used generics to accomplish this task efficiently and safely. I then used generics to write a getMax() method finding the maximum value of an array. Finally, I used example 1.18 from the textbook as a template for using a Function Object to compare a character array.

Files: Main.java contains parts 1-5 and Part6.java contains part 6.

To run: Save the java files, compile, and run.
