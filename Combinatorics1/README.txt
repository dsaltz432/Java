Lab4

This lab contains one file and one class named Combinatorics1. This lab focused on combinatorics. Part1 calculated counting assignments. Part2 calculated permutations. Part3 calculated ordered selections, and part4 calculated unordered selections. The lab required the use of the BigInteger class because some factorials became too large for ints or floats to properly handle the answers.
